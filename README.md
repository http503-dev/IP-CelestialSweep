!! Project Name - Celestial Sweep !!
Celestial Sweep is a cosmic adventure game where the primary objective is to clean up space by collecting and disposing of space debris to earn points which can be redeemed for in-game power ups or real life merch of the game. 

Players are able to participate in community challenges and work together to reach an objective or play for fun while completing their own missions to gain more points.


!! Design Process !!
Our design process is driven by a user-centric approach, targeting both gaming enthusiasts and environmentally conscious individuals. The colour scheme of purple and black, combined with a captivating space/galaxy theme, reflects the immersive and cosmic nature of our space trash game. Players visiting our website aim to understand the game's unique features and contribute to a larger purpose. The inclusion of charity donations, where players can use earned points to make a positive impact, aligns with the values of those seeking meaningful engagement in their gaming experiences.

Our website serves as a gateway to the game's universe, offering an overview and an enticing preview of the gameplay to show players what the actual game is like and its features. It emphasises the real-world impact players can have by showcasing charity initiatives tied to in-game achievements. The trivia section adds an interactive and engaging element, providing players with an opportunity to earn extra points while enhancing their knowledge about space and environmental causes.
As a game developer, I want to code the trivia game so that we can engage users.
As a front-end developer, I want to integrate api's so that our website is interactive.
As a front-end developer, I want to make the website look appealing so that potential users don't get put off.
As a front-end developer, I want to set-up the base code for our website (not finalised, placeholders) so that we have an easier time finalising the website.
